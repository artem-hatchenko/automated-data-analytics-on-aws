## DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE
## This file is simply used to proxy dependencies during development
## from ../services/data-product/components/schema-preview/docker-image/pyproject.toml
## to support static typing and referencing of modules from that package.
##
## All dependencies MUST be added to that file, as this file is never installed in docker build.
## In the future connectors will support full decoupling to avoid this limitation.
##
## Modules from the docker image can be referenced via `import handlers.xxxx` (eg: import handlers.common).
## Which mirrors the final runtime module structure in the docker image.
